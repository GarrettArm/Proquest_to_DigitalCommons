A content analysis of coverage from 1991 to 1996 in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times was compared to American government documents and pronouncements on Uzbekistan. Striking similarities between U.S. policy towards Uzbekistan and the negative interpretation of events appearing in American newspapers were found. The democracy and human rights agendas advanced by U.S. officials apparently prompted editors and reporters to focus more on these subjects, while overlooking other topics. The author argues that the continuing dependence of American media on government sources does not contribute to broad understanding of important issues. Rather, the overall impact of the interplay between press and government deprives the general public of a coherent view about foreign countries.\n",

As available pine increased, termite survival and food consumption increased but search tunnel volume decreased. Increased food size resulted in termites excavating fewer exploratory tunnels due to decreases in secondary and tertiary branch tunnels. An increase in food size also decreased the total length of a search tunnel network, due to decreases in primary and secondary branch order lengths. Search tunnel networks had proportionally more length devoted to primary tunnels and proportionally less to secondary tunnel length as available food size increased. This experiment supports that the Formosan subterranean termite adjusts search activity in response to available food size and this behavior should be considered when determining bait placement for termite control.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aFrom the perspective of those in the underside of history, contemporary education has so stagnated that it has lost its capacity to be a force for social change in a world plagued by social cruelties and injustice. Liberation theologians have shown considerable success in redirecting tightly institutionalized and intellectualized religious communities from their weddedness to imperial notions and practices of faith into one solidly aligned with the struggle of the poor and the marginalized. These theologians of the poor make a distinction between Christianity and Christendom---the former being the vision of a Jewish religious reformer named Yeshua and the latter being the result over the centuries of the imperial co-optation of this vision in the fourth century by Emperor Constantine. By reconceiving faith as engaged solidarity with the oppressed in their work against all forms of oppression, liberation theologians turn faith into a powerful force in the social transformation needed as a condition for the possibility of a genuine love for neighbor. This study heuristically employs the key concepts of liberation theology in liberating curricular and pedagogical notions and practices from their anchorage in individualistic, consumeristic culture and in the military-industrial complex  for a landscape of learning and teaching promotive of and conducive to social change. Reconceiving curriculum and instruction as conscientization and shared learning---grounded in the experience of those marginalized and excluded in the knowledge production process---can both reignite education's emancipatory fire and make teaching and learning powerful non-violent forces for social change.\n",

In addition, a rival hypothesis of demand characteristics was examined as a possible explanation of any findings of the reduction of judgmental errors. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or a debiasing group and asked to rate the likelihood of several hypothetical events in a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (Gender x Anxiety Group x Treatment Group x Repeated Measure) repeated measures experimental design. Level of anxiety responsiveness was measured to arrange subjects into a \"normal\" and a highly anxious group. It was hypothesized that highly anxious participants would report higher probability estimates of future threat-related events relative to participants with a \"normal\" level of anxiety responsiveness, a main effect for anxiety. Secondly, it was hypothesized that a two-way interaction of treatment group and repeated measure upon threat probability ratings would be found. Third, it was hypothesized that a two-way interaction of gender and anxiety upon threat probability ratings would be found. Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be no main effects or interaction effects involving the repeated measure and the experimental demand independent variable. A mixed factorial design 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted using the threat probability ratings as the dependent variable. In addition, two separate analyses were conducted using the experimental demand stimuli as the dependent variable to investigate demand characteristics as an explanation of the debiasing. The results showed that the debiasing procedure was effective in the reduction of judgmental errors. In addition, it was found that demand characteristics could not account for the reduction in pessimistic threat-related predictions. The results were discussed in terms of cognitive biases and implications for cognitive behavior therapy.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aHaemonchus contortus is a serious constraint for sheep production in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The use of genetically resistant animals is a promising alternative for controlling nematode infections without relying on the use of anthelmintics. Extensive epidemiological studies demonstrated that Gulf Coast Native sheep are naturally resistant to  H. contortus infection, but the mechanism underlying this resistance is not well known. The main purpose of this research was to define the components of the immune response that may be involved in resistance of GCN to  H. contortus infection. Three studies were conducted. In the first study, a group of neonate lambs was treated with dexamethasone for ten weeks while grazing on pasture with their dams. All lambs were monitored weekly for blood packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cell differential, and fecal egg count (FEC) for the duration of the study. The second study was similar to the first one but post-weaned lambs were used. They were kept in dirt floored pens and experimentally infected. Treated lambs showed higher FEC and nematode burden and lower PCV and antibody titer to H. contortus whole nematode antigen, compared to controls. These studies indicate that there is a component of the immune response that may play a role in the natural resistance of GCN sheep to H. contortus infection. To further characterize components of the immune response, a third study was conducted in which a group of GCN lambs was depleted of their CD4+ T lymphocytes and challenge with H. contortus infective larvae. The lambs in the treatment group received serial injections of mouse monoclonal antibody to sheep CD4+ T lymphocytes. Lambs in the treatment group showed higher FEC and nematode burden than the controls. These results indicated that CD4+ T lymphocytes were important in immunity of GCN sheep to H. contortus infection. This research has contributed to the better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying natural resistance of GCN sheep to Haemonchus contortus infection.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aThe present investigation examined the psychosocial correlates of eating disorder symptoms among a young sample of Black female adolescents. Recent epidemiological investigations have documented higher rates of disordered eating in Black females than had previously been reported. Because of the high prevalence of these symptoms both in majority and in minority populations, many eating disorder researchers are promoting preventive strategies to stem further increases in symptom levels. To this end, several longitudinal investigations have been conducted to delineate the risk factors of disordered eating among White adolescent populations. However, Black adolescents have been minimally represented in these samples. Thus, there is a dearth of knowledge of the psychosocial correlates of eating disorder symptoms among young Black females. The purpose of this investigation was to examine these correlates among a Black, female adolescent sample. Correlates examined included social pressure for thinness from the media, from mothers, and from peers; pubertal development; and self-esteem. Results indicated that young Black females experience some unique pressures that may necessitate tailored preventive interventions. More specifically, Black female adolescents experienced conflicting weight and shape goals from different social contexts, pressure to gain weight from their mothers and teasing about weight from their peers. Further, self-esteem was examined as a mediator of environmental pressures for thinness and eating disorder symptoms. In the Black sample, self-esteem was found to partially mediate the relationship between media influence and eating disorder symptoms; while self-esteem was found to totally mediate the relationship between teasing and eating disorder symptoms. The strength of these relationships was not as strong in the White adolescent sample, although the pattern of relationships was consistent. Thus, it is possible that these conflicting pressures from different social contexts contribute to a greater negative evaluation of oneself than consistent pressure for slenderness. Further, these pressures may be particularly potent during adolescent transitions, as Black adolescents were more bothered by the changes associated with puberty than the White adolescents. The implications of these conflicting pressures and their negative relationship with self-esteem are discussed in terms of future preventive intervention.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aThe complex of rites, rituals, and mythic reenactments known in Irish mythology as the Rites of Tara provides an interpretive model for James Joyce's  Finnegans Wake. Using information and theories pertaining to the Rites of Tara obtained from sources used by James Joyce, a comparison of the Rites of Tara with Finnegans Wake reveals important correlates related to chronology, characters, architectonics, themes, and defining characteristics. The three separate chronological events presented by Wakean scholars as possible dates for the events in the Wake---Easter, an unnamed pagan festival, and the Vernal Equinox---converged on a single day at the Rites of Tara. The model of the Rites of Tara can thus resolve the controversy over the date and occasion of Finnegans Wake. The dramatis personae of Finnegans Wake---the  Sigla Group---are nearly identical in names, number, and functions to the ritual functionaries conducting the Rites of Tara. The larger structure of Finnegans Wake---the Viconian cycle of Religion, Marriage, Wake and Ricorso---correlates with the major events of the Rites of Tara, which cluster around the same four Viconian components. The individual episodes in Finnegans Wake have their analogues in the distinctive rites, rituals, and performances that collectively constitute the Rites of Tara. The great themes of Finnegans Wake---the Celtic Triangle, the superannuation of the father, the manifestation of antinomial forces as a cosmic pattern of existence, cyclical renewal as a property of both the human soul and the seasons---are identical to the religious principles expressed through the Rites of Tara. The three most distinctive characteristics of Finnegans Wake---its origin in the dream of \"Old Finn,\" its microcosmic qualities, and most significantly, its language---all have their important analogues in the Rites of Tara. Collectively, these parallels between the Rites of Tara and Finnegans Wake indicate a deliberate and comprehensive mythic structure underlying Finnegans Wake based closely on the paradigms of the pre-Christian religion of Ireland. Current assessments of Finnegans Wake have identified no underlying structure to Finnegans Wake. The critical interpretations of Finnegans Wake are, at present, built in large part upon this current assessment. The interpretive model provided by the Rites of Tara, however, strongly reinforces James Joyce's own assessment of Finnegans Wake as the sacred canon of a new (or renewed) religion.\n",

The ichthyoplankton and juvenile fish assemblages were sampled at Green Canyon 18 (GC 18; 230 m depth, shelf slope); Grand Isle 94 (GI 94; 60 m depth, mid-shelf); and South Timbalier 54 (ST 54; 20 m depth, inner shelf) with passive plankton nets and light-traps and at a coastal rock jetty (Belle Pass; 3--5 m depth) with a light-trap and a plankton pushnet. At all sites clupeiforms dominated samples, comprising 59--97% of the total catch. Results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov length-frequency comparisons of fish collected in plankton nets vs. light-traps (platforms) indicated light-traps generally collected significantly larger individuals. At the jetties, greater overlap in size distributions was observed for comparisons of the pushnet and light-trap. Reef-dependent (e.g., pomacentrids, scarids, chaetodontids and labrids) and reef-associated (e.g., serranids, lutjanids, blenniids and holocentrids) taxa were relatively rare in our collections compared to coastal pelagic (scombrids and carangids) and demersal taxa (sciaenids), which are also often associated with petroleum platforms. Taxonomic richness and diversity was highest at mid-shelf platform (GI 94), possibly a result of its proximity to a high density of upstream and surrounding platforms which may create generally favorable conditions for the recruitment of reef taxa. Preflexion and early larval stages of reef-dependent and reef-associated fishes were collected at the outer shelf platform (blenniids, holocentrids, serranids, lutjanids and scarids), mid-shelf platform (pomacentrids, blenniids, holocentrids, lutjanids and serranids), and inner shelf platform (blenniids and lutjanids), suggesting nearby spawning or local supply. Similarly, presettlement and settlement-sized reef-dependent and reef-associated fishes were collected at the outer shelf (pomacentrids, scarids, blenniids, serranids, lutjanids and holocentrids), midshelf (pomacentrids, blenniids, serranids, lutjanids and holocentrids), and inner shelf (labrids, blenniids, serranids and lutjanids) platforms. With the limited amount of hard-substrate habitat available in the northern Gulf, the addition of artificial habitats (platforms) may increase the chances of finding suitable spawning or settlement habitat.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aThe eukaryotic initiation factor 3e is a subunit of the eIF3 complex that was found to mediate the interaction between eIF4G and eIF3 complex. eIF3e was initially found as one of the common integration sites of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), an integration that lead to the formation of mammary epithelial tumors in mice. Integration of MMTV into eIF3e induces the formation of truncated gene products and the potential formation of truncated forms of the protein. It has been shown that the ectopic expression of truncated eIF3e alone, without MMTV sequences or without disrupting endogenous eIF3e alleles, is sufficient to induce malignant transformation in mammalian cells and tumor formation in transgenic mice, but the mechanisms used by truncated eIF3e to cause transformation are not understood. In the present work, we investigate if 3e5 affects protein synthesis in a way that may explain its ability to transform cells and cause tumors. Two different mouse cell lines were used during the present work: HC11 and NIH3T3. In both cases, the cells were transfected with vectors that allow the constitutively expression of truncated eIF3e. The NIH3T3 model system closely mimics the integration of MMTV into only one allele of the eIF3e gene. Cells expressing truncated eIF3e exhibited reduced rates of protein synthesis, which was observed by incorporation of radio-labeled methionine. We tested the capacity of these cells to induce translation in a cap-independent manner using a bicistronic mRNA from which firefly luciferase is expressed in a cap-dependent manner whereas  Renilla luciferase is expressed in a cap-independent manner from the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) element. Using this strategy, we observed enhanced translation of cap-independent  Renilla luciferase in cells expressing truncated eIF3e. Since exogenously introduced mRNAs do not undergo a \"nuclear experience\" and may not behave exactly the same as endogenous mRNAs, so we also tested the polysome distribution of endogenous mRNAs. An increase in polysome size indicates an increase in initiation rate relative to elongation/termination. We found that  GAPDH, actin, L32 and  L34 mRNAs (cap-dependent) shifted to lower polysomes in cells expressing truncated eIF3e, while the IRES-containing mRNAs for XIAP,  c-Myc, CYR61, and Pim-1 shifted to heavy polysomes. Our results support a model where expression of truncated eIF3e tips the balance toward cap-independent translation, thereby causing upregulation of known oncoproteins such as c-Myc and inhibitors of apoptosis such as XIAP..\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aWhat the adult does during the intertrial interval that the child does not to process information was under investigation in this series of studies. Representative ages chosen due to a difference in the utilization of control processes were 5-, 7-, 11-, and 19-year olds. The initial study tested the initial availability of information to the subject prior to processing. The major question was detecting developmental differences in kinesthetic sensory store. Results indicated that the superior performance of the adults is not due to the initial availability of the information. The second study investigated the detriment to performance by increasing the number of to-be-recalled movements. For recall of one position minimal age differences were evident. When required to recall three positions, the 5-year olds performed differently from the 7-, 11-, and 19-year olds. For recall of five movements, the 11- and 19-year olds responded similarly but all other age combinations performed differently. The conclusions of this study indicated that the older children and adults were able to recall longer series of movements with decreased error when compared to the younger children. With the results of the first two studies in mind, the developmental usage of control processes of organization and rehearsal were investigated. For the organization study, three groups were utilized at each age: organized input, unorganized input and training of organization. Results indicated that the 5-year olds recalled on an instance-by-instance basis and did not utilize the organization cues or restructure the input. The 7-year olds made use of the organizational cues but did not restructure the information. During a transfer task, although they realized the similarity among positions, they failed to transfer the organizational strategy. The 11-year olds utilized an organizational strategy when given organized input and then transferred the strategy to a new task. However, when given unorganized input, they failed to restructure the information. The 19-year olds on the other hand utilized the organizational cues when available and restructured the information for improved recall. The rehearsal study also included three groups at each age level: child-like strategy (rote rehearsal), self-determined strategy (subject initiated), and adult-like strategy (rehearsing in groups of 3). Results indicated improved performance of the 5- and 7-year olds when forced to rehearse like adults. Their performance was improved that they did not perform differently than 11- or 19-year olds forced to practice like children. The general conclusions suggested the superior performance of the older children and adults was not due to the initial availability of the information but an increased ability of the subject to utilize control processes of organization and rehearsal.\n",

(7) Anglos in the bilingual program did not change differentially in reading achievement from Anglos in the regular English program. (8) Bilingual program students did not change differentially in language achievement from regular classroom students. (9) Females in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from females in the regular English program. (10) Males in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from males in the regular English program. (11) Black children in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from black children in the regular English program. (12) White students in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from white students in the regular English program. (13) Francos in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from Francos in the regular English program. (14) Anglos in the bilingual program did not change differentially in language achievement from Anglos in the regular English program. (15) Among students of high educational ability, no significant differential change in language achievement existed between bilingual education students and regular English students. However, group ability interaction made a significant difference for the other two levels. The change in language achievement for low ability students in the experimental and control groups was significantly different from pretest to posttest in favor of the low ability students in the control group. Also, the change in language achievement for average ability students in the experimental and control groups was significantly different from pretest to posttest in favor of the average ability students in the experimental group. (16) A significant change in educational ability occurred from pretest to posttest for students in the total population depending on the ability level. This may represent regression toward the mean. Low ability students in the total population gained in educational ability, average ability students remained the same in educational ability, and high ability students lost in educational ability from pretest to posttest. Also, the mean difference in educational ability score for average ability students from pretest to posttest was significant in favor of students in the control group. (17) Students in the bilingual education classes made a significant gain in French language ability from pretest to posttest. This difference was significant at the .01 level.\n",

      "=520  \\\\$aFour experiments were conducted to evaluate carcass characteristics, palatability, chemical traits and shear values of cattle produced on pasture (primarily bermudagrass and ryegrass), pasture plus  1/2% or 1% of body weight in grain or finished on a concentrate ration. Angus or Angus x Hereford cattle were used in Experiments 1, 2 and 3 but Experiment 4 contained straightbred Angus and Hereford along with crosses of Angus, Hereford, Brahman and Charolais cattle in various combinations. Age at slaughter was 23 and 20 months for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Age in Experiments 3 and 4 varied with treatments because of the experimental design. Number of animals per treatment varied from 10 to 24 among the four experiments. Carcass data were taken for all animals. An 18 cm portion of the blade chuck, the short loin (tenderloin removed) and the top round from one side were cut, wrapped and frozen at -16 C for distribution to consumer panels in Experiments 1, 2 and 3. Loin, chuck, rib, round, rump and sirloin cuts were delivered to cooperating retail food stores for fabrication into retail cuts used in the retail study. Loin steaks, rib roasts and round steaks were cut and frozen for laboratory panel evaluation in Experiment 2. Ribeye steaks were obtained from each carcass in Experiment 4 for laboratory panel evaluation. Fat samples for rancidity (thiobarbituric acid) and fatty acid analysis were taken from subcutaneous fat above the longissimus muscle. Loin steaks were used in Experiments 1, 2 and 3 for evaluation of pH and shear. Forage-fed cattle in Experiment 1 had less fat thickness than cattle fed  1/2% grain-on-grass or fed concentrate free-choice for 63, 78 or 108 days. Evaluation of chuck, loin and round steaks by a 150 household consumer panel showed panelists preferred (P < .05) the loin steaks from grain-fed treatments over limited grain or forage treatments for tenderness and flavor. The forage treatment also had a higher (P < .05) pH than treatments receiving grain. There were significant differences (P < .01) for all carcass characteristics in Experiment 2. Differences were usually between the forage treatment and the grain-fed treatments (1% grain-on-grass, 70 to 140 day feedlot treatments). A 273 household consumer panel found chuck steaks to be less (P < .05) tender and loin steaks to be less (P < .05) juicy from forage-fed cattle compared to grain-fed cattle. Fewer treatment differences were observed in consumer ratings after adjustment for variation in marbling and backfat. Retail panel evaluation indicated a difference (P < .05) in flavor of cuts from the round between the forage and those treatments receiving grain. Laboratory ratings indicated lower (P < .01) flavor and overall satisfaction ratings of loin steaks from forage cattle than from grain-fed cattle. Fat from the forage treatment was least (P < .05) rancid and had the highest (P < .05) pH. Forage cattle in Experiment 3 had less fat thickness (P < .01), less kidney fat (P < .01), less marbling (P < .01) and lower (P < .05) quality grade than grain-fed cattle (1% grain-on-grass, 70 days feedlot or 60 days 1% grain-on-grass plus 70 days feedlot). A 168 household consumer panel indicated a greater (P < .05) preference for concentrate-fed treatments compared to the grain-on-grass treatment. Fat from the forage treatment was least (P < .05) rancid. There were significant differences (P < .01) for all carcass characteristics except yield grade and hot weight in Experiment 4. Panelists preferred the flavor of rib steaks (P < .01) and fat from the grain-fed treatment (198 days feedlot). Differences (P < .01) in fatty acid composition were greatest for C18:0 (stearic) and C18:1 (oleic).\n",
